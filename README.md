Requirements

your discussion in your own words must be a minimum of 500 words (THIS IS NOT INCLUDING THE CASE STUDY ITSELF OR ANY OTHER REFERENCED ITEMS) -- THIS must be 100% original writing by you.
MUST be in a pdf format.
 

 

PART 1) CASE SYNOPSIS :

Identify Stakeholders - Clearly define stakeholders in the case
Describe Case - Describe in detail the case and what the issues are as well as the results
state the stakeholders' reactions to the actions and decisions of the people in the case based upon their personal ethical framework. You are not graded upon their values, but upon how well you can state them to argue a position related to the scenario.
References - You must properly CITE your references inside your text (see below part 5 on info on how to do this)

 

PART 2) PERSONAL ETHICS:

Analysize the case with regards to YOUR personal ethics. all of the actions that were taken, and all of the alternative actions that could have been taken.
References - You must properly CITE your references inside your text if any are used in this section(see below part 5 on info on how to do this)


CLARIFICATION: your members in your group may not have the same personal code of ethics. In this case, describe each of the viewpoints and how the differ an how
IMPORTANT - while it is easy to just say "The group believes X is true". Try to add support for your viewpoint. For example you would say "The group bielieves X is true. This viewpoint is supported by the authors in [***reference***] that discuss how *******". So you are backing up your own personal ethics with cited references of papers/articles/websites/blogs that disucss similar viewpoints.
PART 3) PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

Pick a professional organization (ACM, IEEE, etc) related to this computer ethics case . Then you analyze the scenario using the Code of Ethics of this professional society stating the specific principles/rules from the professional organization's ethics rules/code that apply to the case issues and what the right course of actions are based upon that code.
References - You must properly CITE your references inside your text (see below part 5 on info on how to do this)

IMPORTANT: make sure when you are discussing an organizatios ethics code to quote/cite certain points/sections of the code. For example you might say, "In Item 3c of the ACM code of ethics [***reference ***] ACM discuss how *******. This can be applied in the case where *****". Now you do not need to use my exact verbiage but, what I am trying to show you is that I want you to be specific and quote certain sections of the professional code of ethics as they apply to the issues you are discussing in your case.
 

PART 4)COMPARE: Finally, you are to compare and contrast the conclusions made in parts 1 and 2 .

Compare how your personal response is different to the professional societies or how it is the same. If there are differences give reasons WHY your opinion is different and why you believe it is superior.
PART 5) REFERENCES: properly document your references
